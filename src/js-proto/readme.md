## First implementation of basic functionality in JS

This is a port of the bash script to JS. When reverse-engineering a client/API I like to do the first attempt in bash as a quick proof of concept.

Now that I know it works, I am using the bash script & comments as documentation to implement it in JS. Then I will reverse the login/booking/cancelling flow and extend the JS version accordingly. Ultimately it will be a TypeScript library that can be reliably used as part of a larger application.
